# The Hard Parts of UI Development - Challenges

## Summary
The purpose of these challenges is to learn an under-the-hood understanding of building user interfaces in the web browser. Each challenge will go hand-in-hand with the live workshop presentation. Topics covered will include data-binding in UI development, HTML & markup in the web browser, and JavaScript & the DOM API. 

## How do I get started?

### Part 1: 

1. Take a look at the `index.html` file. Add a few elements to it and when open this file in the browser to see your elements rendered to the page. To open your code in the browser: 
    
    **Mac users:** Right-click on the `index.html` file and select 'reveal in finder'. Once you're in the finder, you should be able to open `index.html` with your default web browser. 
    
    **PC users:** Double-click `index.html` or right-click and select 'open with file explorer'. Once you're in the file explorer, you should be able to open `index.html` with your defult browser.

2. Add some basic styling to your elements in the `styles.css`. 

3. Type in your `input` to update the data in the DOM. 

4. Uncomment the script for `part1.js` at the bottom of `index.html`. This script acts as a link between the `html` and any JavaScript logic in the appropriate JavaScript file. 

5. Inside of `part1.js`, update the DOM (such as the text in your created `div`). 

6. Add an event handler to let the user update our JS dta.
